# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-02)

**Core value:** When a sale email arrives, the system auto-deducts component stock via EAN compositions, computes FIFO-based profit including fixed costs, and records everything durably in the database — no manual intervention, no browser cache dependency.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Keep vanilla JS frontend — only touch localStorage→DB wiring, XSS fixes, code organization
- Init: Supabase client direct (CDN) for CRUD; PostgreSQL RPC functions for atomic ops (FIFO, sale processing)
- Init: Python email service kept, rewired from InvenTree API to direct PostgreSQL writes
- [Phase 01-foundation]: UUID primary keys on all tables using gen_random_uuid() from pgcrypto extension
- [Phase 01-foundation]: ean_compositions uses TEXT FK to products.ean for EAN-driven composition resolution without joins

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Open: Supabase hosted vs self-hosted — must decide before Phase 1 plan execution
- Open: Thin REST API vs Supabase direct browser client — affects Phase 2 wiring approach
